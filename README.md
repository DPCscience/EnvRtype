# **Background**

Envirotyping-based data has proven useful in identifying the environmental drivers of
phenotypic adaptation in plant breeding. Combined with phenotyping and genotyping data, the use of envirotyping data may leverage the molecular breeding strategies to cope with environmental changing scenarios. Over the last 10 years, this data has been incorporated in genomic-enabled prediction models aiming to better model genotype x environment interaction (GE) as a function of reaction norm.  However, there is difficult for most breeders to deal with the interplay between envirotyping, ecophysiology, and genetics. Here we present the EnvRtype R package as a new instrument developed to facilitate the interplay between envirotyping and genomic prediction. This package offers three modules: (1) collection and processing tools; (2) environmental characterization;(3) build of ecophysiological enriched genomic prediction models accounting for three different structures of reaction norm. Here we focus our efforts to present a practical use of EnvRtype package in supporting the genome-wide prediction of reaction norms.

# **Install**

```{r}
library(devtools)
install_github("allogamous/EnvRtype")
```



# **Features and Functionality**

EnvRtype consists of the following three modules, which collectively generate a simple workflow to collect, process and integrated envirotyping into genomic prediction in multiple environments.

## Environmental Sensing Module (ES)


## Environmental Characterization Module (EC)


## Reaction Norm Module (RN)
